h1.  ScullyTown Rails Template

A workhorse Rails 2.3 template we use for the majority of our projects, based on the original "Thoughtbot Suspenders template":http://github.com/thoughtbot/suspenders.

Note:
This is a work-in progress and continually updated. Please feel free to fork this project and make it better!

h3.  How to use

To use this template, run the following command:

<pre><code>
  rails -d mysql -m http://github.com/scullygroup/scully-rails-template/raw/master/scullyonrails.rb /path/to/app/appname
</code></pre>

h3.  Key Features

* User Authentication using AuthLogic
* Email verification for user accounts created using AuthLogic
* Comatose CMS installed as a Rails Engine
* Comatose Rake-n-Bake support for populating page tree from Freemind sitemap, "http://github.com/scullygroup/Comatose-Rake-n-Bake/tree/":http://github.com/scullygroup/Comatose-Rake-n-Bake/tree/
* Role-based authentication with reserved roles (admin, publisher, writer, user)

*A Word About Roles*
When the app is generated from the template, a few reserved roles are created:
* Admin, full access to entire app
* Publisher, full access to CMS
* Writer, read/write access to entire CMS, but no publishing rights
* User, login/logout functionality only, cannot access any backend controller actions (this is the low-level user role upon account creation)

From here, you can create additional "writer-level" roles that can be assigned to parent pages in the CMS.  For example, you could create a role called "Human Resources", which could be assigned access to the "About Us" parent page and all of it's children.  Currently, only one role can be assigned per parent.

When a "writer-level" user creates/edits a page, an email is sent to the user(s) in the Publisher role prompting them to login and review the page before publishing.

TODO
* Assign roles to controller actions
* Differentiate between "Writer" and user-generated writer roles
* Create Baseline Tests!
